# Botw NX Fixer

This tool is made to quickly fix WiiU converted Switch (NX) mods.

It currently fixes Havok files, which were previously corrupted by BCML's converter until [this PR](https://github.com/NiceneNerd/BCML/pull/479), and also broken in [Nitram's Ultimate Converter](https://github.com/Nitr4m12/UltimateBotWConverter).

***Note:** This is not a standalone converter, and must be used with [this patch](.\patch\converter.py) of [Nitram's Ultimate Converter](https://github.com/Nitr4m12/UltimateBotWConverter)*

## Setup

- Download the latest release from this page, and extract it anywhere on your PC.
- Drag and drop your _switch converted_ bnp onto the exe and wait for the fixer to complete.
- **(Only on pre-3.10.2 BCML versions):** Download [dev.py]() from BCML's source to get the edits before BCML **3.10.2**
